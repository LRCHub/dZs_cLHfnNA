I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress, but we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress
Tell me what you're waiting for
'Cause I know what you wanna do
Picture perfect criminal
A little foul play won't burn your pretty face
Know you want to keep me close
But I got places I wanna go, yeah
Good and evil give me more
Never hold back, I like it like that
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (boom, boom now)
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (oh-oh)
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress, but we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress
Back to the beginning, let's turn to chapter one
This goes out to women who's shaking history up
We're flawless and we're fearless deserve to have some fun
Take the back seat, you know I like that
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom

Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
I wish for what's forbidden
