I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress
But we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress
Tell me what you're waiting for
'Cause I know what you wanna do
Picture perfect criminal
A little foul play won't burn your pretty face
Know you want to keep me close
But I got places I wanna go, yeah
Good and evil give me more
Never hold back, I like it like that
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (boom, boom now)
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (oh-oh)
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress
But we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress
I'm a mess, I'm a know it all
In a dress but I'm not your doll
I'm poisonous, throw a fit
Blow a kiss and make your skin crawl
'Cause if it's gonna kill me
Least I'll look good on the fall
Gimme blood and I'll give you salt
Break me up and against the wall
'Cause I like it better outside my mind
It gets reckless inside my head
I'm dramatic pretty and pressed
Emotional and upset
Guess I'll be over it when I'm dead
Baby, I'm a mess
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (boom, boom now)
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (oh-oh)
What you waiting for?
Show me what you're scared of
We fall, fall, fall (oh-oh)
What you looking for?
This is who we are now
We fall, we fall, we fall (we fall, we fall)
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (boom, boom now)
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it)
Girl, wanna have fun (girl)
Girl, wanna have fun (girl)
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Girl, wanna have fun (girl)
Girl, wanna have fun (girl)
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
