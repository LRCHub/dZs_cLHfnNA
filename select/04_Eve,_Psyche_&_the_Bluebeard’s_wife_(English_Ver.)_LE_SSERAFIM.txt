I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress but we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress
Tell me what you're waiting for
'Cause I know what you wanna do
Picture perfect criminal
A little foul play won't burn your pretty face
Know you want to keep me close
But I got places I wanna go, yeah
Good and evil give me more
Never hold back, I like it like that
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom now
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
(Push it) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
(Push it) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress but we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress
Zoom in zoom out, smile bigger for the crowd
Shut up, shut up now, shut your feelings out
Keep it, keep it down, tell me I'm too loud
Better watch your mouth, it comes back around
Hush, now, girl just close your eyes
They tell me, "Never cross the line," yeah
Forbidden fruit, want a bite
Take it on the chain, I know I like that
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom now
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
(Push it) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
(Push it) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
What you waiting for?
Show me what you're scared of
We fall, fall, fall
What you looking for?
This is who we are now, we fall, we fall, we fall
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom now
Boom, boom, boom, got my heartbeat pumping
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
